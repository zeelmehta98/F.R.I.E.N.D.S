            starring Jennifer Aniston, courteney Cox, Matt LeBlance
            Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow.<br>
            Filming of the show took place at Warner Bros. 
            Studios in Burbank, California. All ten seasons of Friends ranked<br>

            Friends has developed an alternative family lifestyle by
            representing young people that live unconventional domestic lives.<br>
            It presents the idea that "all you need is good friends" and can
            construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify<br>
            with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. 
            It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships<br> 
            which are not normally seen in conventional society. According 
            to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, <br>
            Friends is "one of those rare shows that marked a change in 
            American culture." The images of youth and the roles they portray are<br> 
            better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating 
            and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and <br>
            seeking help from each other.
